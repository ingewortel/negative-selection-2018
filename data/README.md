# Input data

This folder contains the input data, the 6-mer letter/AA sequences used for the analyses
in this manuscript. See the description below and the methods section of the manuscript
for details.

## Languages
The `languages/` folder contains the 6-mer sequences used in figures 2 and 3 of the manuscript:

- en_t.txt : 6-mer sequences extracted from the book Moby Dick, which were used to sample non-overlapping training- and test sets. Sequences labelled as "self" in Figures 2/3 were derived from this set.
- en2-unseen.txt : 6-mer sequences extracted from the English translation of the bible, of which none also occur in en_t.txt. These sequences were used to generate the datapoint "English (different book)" in Figure 3F.
- me-unseen.txt : 6-mer sequences extracted from a Medieval English translation of the bible. None overlap with the strings in en_t.txt. 
- pd-unseen.txt : 6-mer sequences extracted from a Plautdietsch translation of the bible. None overlap with the strings in en_t.txt.
- la-unseen.txt : 6-mer sequences extracted from a Latin translation of the bible. None overlap with the strings in en_t.txt.
- hi-unseen.txt : 6-mer sequences extracted from a Hiligaynon translation of the bible. None overlap with the strings in en_t.txt
- ta-unseen.txt : 6-mer sequences extracted from a Tagalog translation of the bible. None overlap with the strings in en_t.txt.
- xh-unseen.txt : 6-mer sequences extracted from a Xhosa translation of the bible. None overlap with the strings in en_t.txt.
